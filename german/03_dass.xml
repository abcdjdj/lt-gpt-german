    <s>Teacher: Great job with the examples using <lang xml:lang="de-DE">"da."</lang> Now, let's move on to another important conjunction, <lang xml:lang="de-DE">"dass."</lang> It means "that" in English and is used to introduce a subordinate clause. Let's practice some examples to understand its usage.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: Before we start with the examples, let me explain how to use <lang xml:lang="de-DE">"dass."</lang> In German, when you have a sentence where you want to say "that" something is happening or being said, you use <lang xml:lang="de-DE">"dass."</lang> It helps to connect two clauses together. The clause introduced by <lang xml:lang="de-DE">"dass"</lang> is the subordinate clause, providing additional information or clarifying the main clause.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: For example, in the sentence "I know that he is busy," the main clause is "I know" and the subordinate clause is "that he is busy." Here, <lang xml:lang="de-DE">"dass"</lang> introduces the information being known.</s>
