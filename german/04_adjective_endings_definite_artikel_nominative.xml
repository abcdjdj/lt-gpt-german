    <s>Teacher: Now, let's delve into a new topic: adjective endings in the nominative case.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: Let's start with the rule for masculine nouns. When an adjective precedes a singular masculine noun in the nominative case, we add <say-as interpret-as="verbatim">e</say-as> to the adjective.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: For example, to say "The big man," we use the adjective <voice language="de-DE">"groß"</voice> and add <say-as interpret-as="verbatim">e</say-as> because "man" is masculine. So, it becomes <voice language="de-DE">"Der große Mann."</voice></s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: Now, let's practice a few more examples using masculine nouns.</s>
