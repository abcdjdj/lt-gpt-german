    <s>Teacher: For indefinite articles, an easy way to remember the rules is that the adjective takes endings which signify the gender of the noun. As an example, for masculine nouns, we add <say-as interpret-as="verbatim">er</say-as> to the adjective.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: The <say-as interpret-as="verbatim">er</say-as> comes from <voice gender="male" language="de-DE">"der"</voice></s>

  <break time="2500ms" />
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: The word for boy in German, is <voice gender="male" language="de-DE">"Junge"</voice>. That's <say-as interpret-as="verbatim">junge</say-as>, just like "young" in English. We call kids "young ones", don't we?</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: So, to say "A strong boy," we use the adjective <voice gender="male" language="de-DE">"stark"</voice> and add <say-as interpret-as="verbatim">er</say-as> because "boy" is masculine. So, it becomes <voice gender="male" language="de-DE">"Ein starker Junge."</voice></s>

    <s>Teacher: Great job! Now, let's move on to the rule for feminine nouns. Can you guess what ending we must add for feminine nouns?</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Student: <voice gender="female">Just an "-e"?</voice></s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: Perfect. For feminine nouns, we add "-e" to the adjective.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: For example, to say "A beautiful woman," we use the adjective <voice gender="male" language="de-DE">"schön"</voice> and add "-e" because "woman" is feminine. So, it becomes <voice gender="male" language="de-DE">"Eine schöne Frau."</voice></s>

  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Teacher: For neuter nouns, we add <say-as interpret-as="verbatim">es</say-as> to the adjective. The <say-as interpret-as="verbatim">es</say-as> comes from "das".</s>
